## 10/5/2025 9 AM - Started making the Schematic  

Hello, World!
I settled down to a ICE40UP5K-SG48I since it has a QFN package and an OK number of LUTs
Found a crystal suitable for the fpga, and started building the power rails.
I also tried making a power supply filter, but I can't seem to add ferrite beads to the schematic (I'm using Easyeda Pro).

Note that the voltage regulators are still to be chosen, since I want to power an rp2350 on the same board too.  

## 10/5/2025 7 PM - Habemus schematic!  

INSANE rp2350 && ice40 schematic speedrunning session
Just mostly need to get the 40-pin connector in-place
I still have to find the perfect ferrite bead

I also need to add an SPI and UART connection between the rp2350 and the ice40.

By the way, you might be wondering what are those strangely-routed USB and USBc female ports are for, and I will be using those to see if I can make my own TCP/IP stack on the fpga, as a nice side-quest.
